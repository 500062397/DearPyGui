# Marvel Sandbox
<sub>(This library is available under a free and permissive license)</sub>

MarvelSandbox is a **simple to use (but powerful) Python GUI toolkit**, built on top of Dear ImGui. Although the API may seem similar to Dear ImGui, MarvelSandbox does not use the immediate mode paradigm, but instead provides a wrapping that simulates a traditional retained mode GUI.

In the same manner Dear ImGui provides a simple way to create tools for game developers, MarvelSandbox provides a simple way for python developers to **create quick and powerful GUIs for scripts**. It's well suited for **beginners** too!
